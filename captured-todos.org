* Introduction

The section named "Captured" below, holds a list of todos that have been quickly
captured but not organised yet.
These should be moved under the appropriate projects periodically. This can be
done with the =org-refile= (~C-c C-w~) command in emacs, or you can manually
move them over to the appropriate project.

* Captured

The captured tasks go here before being refiled.

* Orders

The captured orders go here before being refiled.
