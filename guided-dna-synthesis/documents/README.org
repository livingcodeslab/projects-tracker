#+TITLE: Guided DNA Synthesis Project Documentation

* Introduction

This directory contains the project documentation, i.e. documentation on
materials, consumables, models etc. that go toward making the project a success.

* Microfluidics Device Documentation

** TODO Remember to document this

* Microfluidics Paper

To build the paper you will need the dependencies listed in the included
[[file:paper-manifest.scm][guix manifest]].

#+INCLUDE "./paper-manifest.scm"

If you are using GNU Guix, and your current working directory is this directory,
then you can get a shell with:

#+begin_src shell
  guix shell --container --network \
       --expose="$(dirname $(pwd))/reports/references.bib" \
       --manifest=paper-manifest.scm
#+end_src

and in the resulting shell, you can build the paper with:

#+begin_src shell
  make -f Makepaper all
#+end_src
