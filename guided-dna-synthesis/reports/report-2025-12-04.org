* Integration

** File down the Older Adapter

I begin the day by closing off completed tasks and noting down what we learnt
from previous experiments regarding the adapters.

Next, I take one of the older adapters, and file it down to fit it more closely
with the dimensions from Graphenea. I went too far 🤦🏿‍♂️!

Put in a small piece of paper to act as spacer and occupy the few micro-metres I
went over.

*** Test Readings With Filed-Down Adapter

Now take readings from the device with the filed-down adapter:

#+begin_src shell
  python3 sweep.py --log-level debug \
          --smu-visa-address ASRL/dev/ttyUSB0::INSTR \
          --line-frequency 60 \
          --nplc 12.5005 \
          --gate-voltage 1.0 \
          --sweep-interval 0.01 \
          --channel-voltage 0.05  \
          2>fd-test-01/2025-12-04/dwater-characterisation-01-events.log | \
      tee fd-test-01/2025-12-04/dwater-characterisation-01-data.csv
#+end_src

which gives the following combined (both positive and negative channel voltages):

#+NAME: 20251204-open-air-xristics-01-combined
[[file:static/20251204-open-air-characterisation-01-data-combined.svg]]

Where we get what are seemingly relatively flat plots (this is a lie).

Zooming in to the positive channel voltages, the plot becomes:

#+CAPTION: 20251204, Open Air Characteristics (+50mV), Old Adapter
#+NAME: 20251204-open-air-xristics-01-positive
[[file:static/20251204-open-air-characterisation-01-data-positive.svg]]

This is like the past results anyway.

Now we push some distilled water using a 20µL pippette into the adapter. We push
in approximately 100µL and run the sweep.

The combined plot becomes

#+CAPTION: 20251204, Distilled Water Characteristics (combined), Old Adapter
#+NAME: 20251204-dwater-xristics-01-combined
[[file:static/20251204-dwater-characterisation-01-data-combined.svg]]

and the positive values give the plot:

#+CAPTION: 20251204, Distilled Water Characteristics (+50mV), Old Adapter
#+NAME: 20251204-dwater-xristics-01-positive
[[file:static/20251204-dwater-characterisation-01-data-positive.svg]]

From this, we see that the expected curve shows up, with the Dirac point being
at around 0.7V.

This verifies that the adapter itself is not the problem, and the issues we were
encountering could have been coming from elsewhere.

** Test Plumbing

We checked the fluidic tubing and realised that one of the tubes might have some
sort of internal blockage.

The process followed was:
- force air through the tube with a syringe to ensure there are no droplets of water in the tubing
- connect one end of tubing to a balloon full of Nitrogen (N_{2})
- dip the other end in a small "pool" of water
- Watch for bubble as you gently apply pressure on the balloon


With the process above, one of the tubing had effervescent bubbling — the other
had no bubbling whatsoever, despite applying considerable pressure on the
balloon.

The conclusion thus, was that we might need more tubing and other plumbing parts
for replacements. We also need to test each of the tubes separately to ensure
that all tubing that we use is clear of blockage/kinks.

** Order Parts

Prepare list of parts to order, and send it out.
