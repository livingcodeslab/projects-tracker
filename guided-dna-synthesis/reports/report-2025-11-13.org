* Integration

Work on processing the data. Main tasks:

- Separate lines in results file into 2 separate files, one for positive channel
  (drain-source) voltage, and one for negative channel voltage.
- Plot the results.

After separating the data and plotting, we get the following plot:

#+CAPTION: Current Changes: Gate current sweep (0V to 1V), Drain voltages (50mv and -50mV)
[[file:static/20251113-currents-with-gate-sweep-and-positive-and-negative-drain.svg]]

We see from the plot that the incessant drop in current (indicated by rise in
resistance) no longer seems to be present. The values seem to swing wildly over
a relatively "flat" middle.

Further analysis might be required to clean up the data and draw useful results
from it.
