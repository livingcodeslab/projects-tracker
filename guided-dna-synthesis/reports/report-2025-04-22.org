Take the characteristics of *chip00* after cleanup with acetone.

In the open-air configuration, after acetone chip-cleanup, the current
characteristics for *chip00* are:

whereas the resistance characteristics are:

In the distilled-water configuration, after acetone chip-cleanup, the current
characteristics for *chip00* are:

whereas the resistance characteristics

These curves support the previous conclusion that the acetone-IPA-nitrogen
chip-cleaning protocol does, indeed, restore the chip properties to near where
they originally were.
