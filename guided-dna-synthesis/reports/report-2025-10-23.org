** Debug Issues

*** Flow

- Troubleshoot flow through the GFET line
  - flow fluid through the GFET line continuously
    - we get a smooth flow for flowing the wash through the GFET line
    - We get the stutters in the venting step
      - look at schematics and firmware code to trace what is happening
  - Watch flows for each channel:
    - stutter on vent, both to waste and collection
- Invert flow: flow mostly solid liquid, with plugs of air as separators
