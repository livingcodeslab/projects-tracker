* Signals' Debug

Today, we'll be probing the voltages applied to various valves when specific
commands are run — this will help verify whether or not the expected signals are
being sent, and addressed correctly.

The microfluidics device has *six* (6) main commands, which are:
- =PRIME=
- =WASH=
- =PURGE=
- =COLLECT=
- =PUMP=
- =WAIT=

Each command above has various options.

In addition to that, the device has *twenty* (20) valves. This leads to an
explosion of possible combinations of commands and valve states.

There are, however, specific valve states that *MUST* be mutually exclusive for
specific commands, for the device to function as expected, e.g for a command,
~COLLECT -C 1 …~, valves /1 and 6/ *MUST* be powered /ON/ *and* /ALL/ other
valves *MUST* be powered *OFF*. (TODO: please verify this)

We'll explore more of these to verify at a high level, whether on not the
firmware and/or circuitry is working as expected.

We'll address the valves clockwise as follows:
- valve =1=: directs fluid from"GFET" either to "collection" or to "waste"
- valve =2=: directs fluid from "Pump" either to the "GFET" or to "waste"
- valve =3=: handles venting air
- valve =4=: controls air/wash to common line
⋮
- valve =6=: chooses reagent 1 or wash for channel 1
⋮
- valve =20=: chooses reagent 1 or wash for channel 8

We use the LHD Series 3-way control solenoid valves, with the central port
(common port) being the inlet. The port closest to the valves wires (and to the
outside of the manifold) is the normally-open (NO) port. The port closest to the
centre of the manifold is the normally-closed (NC) port.

*** Conventions

We'll use the following conventions for the data values:

- ~0~: Indicates there is *NO* power to the valve: (0 V)
- ~1~: Indicates *there is* power to the valve: (11.91 V)
- ~x~: Indicates invalid values for the =var1= argument for the command.
  When these invalid values are provided, the device *SHOULD* do nothing.

** PRIME

*** PRIME CHEM_WASH …

Command: ~PRIME CHEM_WASH var1 …~

The command ~PRIME CHEM_WASH 10 …~ should activate all the same valves as 1 — 8
at different times, starting with channel 8 down to channel 1.

*** PRIME -C …

The command is ~PRIME -C var1 -T 210 -R 36~
The device seems to completely ignore the ~-T 210~ argument and only prime for
about 13 seconds: the timings for 10 attempts are 13.37, 13.39, 13.36, 13.46,
13.25, 13.31, 13.38, 13.40, 13.41, 13.19, seconds.
