Started off with a new Graphenea GFET S-20[fn:gfet-s-20] chip, *chip01* and
attempted to get its characteristics.

The characteristics curve I got for the open-air iteration was:

#+CAPTION: Current Characteristics of Chip01: I_{D} vs. V_{G}: Open-Air
#+NAME: chip01-open-air-current-xristics-01
[[file:images/2025-04-16/chip01/open_air_current_characteristics.svg]]

and with distilled water, I got:

#+CAPTION: Current Characteristics of Chip01: I_{D} vs. V_{G}: Distilled Water
#+NAME: chip01-dwater-current-xristics-01
[[file:images/2025-04-16/chip01/distilled-water-current-characteristics.svg]]

#+NAME: chip01-dwater-resist-xristics-01
[[file:images/2025-04-16/chip01/distilled-water-resistance-characteristics.svg]]

The current characteristics curves are nice and clear.

The resistance characteristics curves are ruined (mostly) by the 50kΩ spike,
which probably occurs at the 4.16×10^{-16}V Gate voltage.

After removing the 4.16×10^{-16}V gate voltage data, the resistance
characteristics graphs become:

#+CAPTION: Resistance Characteristics of Chip01: R_{D} vs. V_{G}: Distilled Water
#+NAME: chip01-dwater-resist-xristics-no-zero-vg
[[file:images/2025-04-16/chip01/distilled-water-resistance-characteristics-no-zero-vg.svg]]

which is much nicer. This also demonstrates that we probably do not want to run
with a gate voltage of near zero, since the characteristics at that point might
be a tad unstable.

  At this point, we used a 1X PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) solution for testing.
  As in *chip00* mentioned previously, this broke the new chip — the
  characteristics for the 1X PBS solution is as follows

#+CAPTION: Current Characteristics of Chip01: I_{D} vs. V_{G}: 1X PBS
#+NAME: chip01-pbs-current-xristics-01
[[file:images/2025-04-16/chip01/pbs-solution-current-characteristics.svg]]

#+CAPTION: Resistance Characteristics of Chip01: R_{D} vs. V_{G}: 1X PBS
#+NAME: chip01-pbs-resist-xristics-01
[[file:images/2025-04-16/chip01/pbs-solution-resistance-characteristics.svg]]

We do get a few curves for the current characteristics, that follow the roughly
bell-shaped curves seen before, though these ones are weird. The resistance
curves, or rather, the lack thereof, is indicative of a problem.

After running the chip with the 1X PBS solution, we attempt to verify whether
the chip was still functioning as expected. The characteristic curves for
open-air and distilled water are as follows, after using the 1X PBS:


- Open-air current characteristics after 1X PBS

The new curves indicate that the new chip, chip01, had its characteristics
drastically altered by the high concentration of PBS (for reference, Graphenea
used 0.001X PBS[fn:gfet-measurement-protocols])

This is, probably the reason why the chips, seemingly, broke.


The mitigation measure planned is to soak the devices in acetone according to to
the documentation from Graphenea[fn:gfet-measurement-protocols].

The two broken chips (*chip00* and *chip01*) were, each, submerged in 1ml of
acetone in a pyrex container (1 chip per container) and left overnight.
