The results above, and those from 2025-05-21 indicate that (at least for the
~PRIME *~ commands) the channels' valves are receiving the appropriate signals.

In addition, valve 2 (which takes the output from the GFET and directs it either
to collection or waste) is also receiving the expected signal (default to waste).

Next we need to test the following:
- Collection (valve 1 should turn on, valve 2 should be off)
- Venting (valve 3 should turn on, and valve 4 should be off)

** Collection

Command: ~COLLECT -C 1 -T 210 -R 36~

*BUG*: Valve 5 being open is irrelevant, since valve 6 ends up closing the wash
channel when it is powered on, and fetching the fluid from the channel 1's fluid
container anyway. Valve 5 is thus, being powered on needlessly.

** Venting

Command: ~PURGE ALL 0 -T 210 -R 36~

*BUG*: It is important that valve 1 be powered so that it prevents the fluid in
the   waste line from flowing into the GFET via the GFET output line. It is
unlikely that the fluid will actually flow back, due to pressure, but having the
valve explicitly closed will ensure it does not.

** Liquid Debug

Reassemble the device and do liquid drop debug

*** ~PRIME CHEM_WASH 1 -T 30 -R 36~

- The drop at the wash-line get's pulled in
- No output on waste line
- Flutters in flow, and eventual blow-out of "PUMP IN" line
- Reassemble and disconnect
- Flow out via "GFET IN" port — debug:

*BUG*: This command pushes the fluid through the GFET, but then powers on valve2
and leaves valve 1 off. This leads to fluid being pushed past the waste port
(for some reason) through valve1, back through the GFET and on to valve2's
"normally open" port. Since valve2 is powered
on, the "normally open" port is closed, which leads to back-pressure, and
finally, the flow to waste occurs.
This also leads to flutters/vibrations in the flow (and possibly a build up in
pressure in the system, which might be what caused the "PUMP IN" plumbing to
blow out, during an earlier test).
