** 2025-04-17 and Before

Used a Graphenea GFET S-20[fn:gfet-s-20] chip and attempted to get device
characteristics. This was the very first chip, and we'll refer to it as *chip00*.

We ran the device in three "modes":
- open-air
- with distilled water
- with 1X PBS solution

The characteristics curves are shown below:

*** Open-Air

The current characteristics curves with the chip in the open-air mode was as follows

while the resistance characteristics were as follows

*** Distilled-Water

The current characteristics were

and the resistance characteristics were

*** 1X Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) Solution

The current characteristics were

and the resistance characteristics were

*** Conclusion

The open-air configuration is not a useful configuration for use, but it does
give us a baseline, and a way to verify operation of the device.

The characteristics curves for distilled water were as expected.

The characteristics curves for 1X PBS were very different from expectations.

The characteristics of the device seem to have been altered significantly after
the 1X PBS round â€” we no longer got expected curves for any of the other two
configurations.
