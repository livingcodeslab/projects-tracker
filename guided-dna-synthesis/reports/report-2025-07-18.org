* Calibration

We calibrate priming of the various line.

We define priming as pulling in the chemical on a particular line until it just
shows up on the common waste line (before GFET).

We run the ~PURGE COMMON 0 -T 120 -R 36~ command between each reading to ensure
there is no fluid in the common line that could interfere with the reading(s).

All the calibration readings will be in the [[file:~/livingcodeslab/projects-tracker/guided-dna-synthesis/calibrations.org::*Readings][Calibrations File]].

** WASH LINE

The prime command is ~PRIME CHEM_WASH 0 -T 30 -R 36~.

** Chemical Channel 01

The prime command is ~PRIME -C 1 -T 30 -R 36~
