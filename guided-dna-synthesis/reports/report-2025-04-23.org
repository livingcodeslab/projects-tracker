Dilute 1X PBS to 0.001X PBS by:
- Put 10μL of 1X PBS in a reagent bottle
- Add 9990μL of distilled water in the same reagent bottle
- Put cap on bottle and shake vigorously

We use *chip00* for the initial trial with the *0.001X PBS* solution.

The current characteristics curves become:

and those for the resistance are:

The results above hint at the cause of the chip seemingly failing after using
1X PBS, and possibly after using 0.001X PBS (we'll verify this later).

It looks like whenever the channel voltage (V_{D}) goes positive, something in
the PBS solution gets deposited onto the chip, such that the characteristics of
the chip are drastically altered. The following images demonstrate this.

The current and resistance characteristics for *chip00* with 0.001X PBS with
channel voltages (V_{D}) from -1.7V to 0.1V are:

Meanwhile, the current and resistance characteristics for *chip00* with 0.001X
PBS with channel voltages (V_{D}) from -1.7V to 0.1V are:

*** Conclusions

- We *can* vary the gate voltage, *V_{G}*, from negative voltages, through zero to
  positive voltages.
- The channel/drain voltage, *V_{D}*, /must always/ remain negative. Positive
  voltages for the channel/drain lead to instabilities in the device.
