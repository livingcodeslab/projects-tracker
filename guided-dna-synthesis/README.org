* Introduction

The *Guided DNA Synthesis* project seeks to investigate and perform DNA
synthesis, guided by electronics and performed in (a) microfluidics
environment(s).

The sections below list the major topics of investigation, and the various
dependencies they have. They also serve as a roadmap, and progress indicator for
the work we are doing here.


* TODO Measure Flow Changes          :livingcodeslab:dnasynthesis:majorgoal:

This requires that the integration of the devices (and software) be complete.
The integration includes:
- [x] Verifying GFET device characteristics
- [ ] Choosing GFET operating points
- [ ] Assembling the manifold, and entire microfluidics device
- [ ] Determining flow-rates for the microfluidics device and the timings for
  getting the fluids on top of the chip
- [ ] Figure out reagents and/or precursors
- [ ] Figure out voltages/currents where reagents are altered
- [ ] Write and debug software for driving all the devices, i.e.
  - SMU
  - Microfluidics device
  - …
- [ ] Assemble and mount AFM
- …


* TODO Block Hybridisation           :livingcodeslab:dnasynthesis:majorgoal:

** TODO Temperature control
- Maybe acquire temperature control devices, e.g. Peltier, etc


* TODO Guided DNA Synthesis          :livingcodeslab:dnasynthesis:majorgoal:

This is waiting on the completion of the following:
- [[*Order materials and tools][Order materials and tools]]
- Reagents: enzymes, DNA, oligos — verify oligos are  okay
- Microfluidics — reassembly of manifold,
- GFET measurements: acquire GFETs, SMU, cleaning GFETS
- Functionalization of GFET: reagents, AFM, PBASE DNA, tests/calibration
- Integration: hardware, software, OPS, tests/calibration
- 


* TODO Validation of Synthesis       :livingcodeslab:dnasynthesis:majorgoal:


* Tasks

** TODO Add nice introduction in the repository :livingcodeslab:gfet:
